# Fizz-Buzz
**Week 2 of learning how to code.** 
We explore working with Ruby and Test Driven Development by building the children's game called *FizzBuzz*. The game can also occur as a coding challenge in job interviews.

### Fizz-Buzz
...is a game for children learn division. Players take turns counting up from one, replacing any number that is divisible by three with the word *'fizz'*, any number divisible by five with the word *'buzz'*, and any number divisible by both three and five to be replaced with *'fizz buzz'*.
